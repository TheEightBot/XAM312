        <h2>Customizing the ListView in Xamarin.Forms - XAM312</h2>
<p>ListView has a limited selection of built-in cell styles. These standard cells handle common cases and you should use them if they meet your needs. If not, you can create a custom cell that will uniquely represent your data and match the overall look-and-feel of your app. This course shows you how to define a row template, how to add headers/footers, and how to display grouped data. You will also survey several performance-tuning strategies including cell caching.</p>
<h3>Upon completion you will be able to:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Create custom cell definitions</li>
<li>Add headers and footers to a ListView</li>
<li>Display grouped data in a ListView</li>
<li>Customize the cell view based on data</li>
<li>Optimize ListView Performance</li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises</h2>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="parts/part1.html">Exercise 1: Provide a custom cell template for a ListView (XAM312)</a>
<br>
<p>This exercise modifies an existing application that displays a list of animals. The app is using a ListView with an ImageCell to display the animals. You will replace the ImageCell with a custom ViewCell template to display additional information and provide additional formatting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part2.html">Exercise 2: Add a header and footer to the ListView (XAM312)</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll add a header and footer definition to a ListView.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part3.html">Exercise 3: Add grouping support to a list (XAM312)</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll add grouping and sorting support to the ListView so that the animals are grouped by the first letter of their name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<a href="parts/part4.html">Exercise 4: Display different cells based on the bound-data (XAM312)</a>
<br>
<p>In this exercise, you'll create and use a DataTemplateSelector to display different cells in a ListView based on the bound data. The application you'll use simulates a &quot;smart home&quot; dashboard that allows the user to see the status and interact with their smart home devices.</p>
</li>
